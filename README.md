Most files belong to Dr Michael Zmuda at Miami University.
The Breakthrough player I created is present at:

The AI plays the board game breakthrough- using minimax and alpha-beta pruning.

Breakthrough rules:

Player can move piece one square forward, left-diagonal, or right-diagonal, but not backwards.
To capture the opponent's piece, player must move diagonal.
